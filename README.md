Project description:
Inventory System

The provided C++ code implements a basic inventory system. It defines a Product class with properties like name, price, and quantity, along with methods to display, update, and retrieve product details. The main function runs a loop that presents a menu of options to the user, including buying items, adding new items, updating item details, displaying inventory, and exiting the program. Users can interact with the system to perform these actions on the products in the inventory.
